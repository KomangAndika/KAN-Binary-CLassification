I use KAN KAN KAN KAN KAN KAN KAN KAN KAN KAN KAN KAN KAN

Honestly i dont know what to write here
Activation Function learns rather than weight i suppose, replacing every weight with spline (Spine much better)

Proved to be better performance than MLP (Multilayer perceptron)
Still  some doubt because it was tested on small dataset

Pros:
- Easier to iterpret
- Smaller storage needed

Cons:
- I didn't read all that paper im bored
