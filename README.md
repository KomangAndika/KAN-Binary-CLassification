I use KAN KAN KAN KAN KAN KAN KAN KAN KAN KAN KAN KAN KAN

Honestly i dont know what to write here <br />
Activation Function learns rather than weight i suppose, replacing every weight with spline (Spine much better) <br />

Proved to be better performance than MLP (Multilayer perceptron) <br />
Still  some doubt because it was tested on small dataset <br />

Pros: <br />
- Easier to iterpret <br />
- Smaller storage needed <br />

Cons: <br />
- slow af evethough  usig the same amout of parameter to MLP <br />

Check out the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19756 <br />
Very gud paper but i can't understand the math and I can't read many sentences (me dumb)
