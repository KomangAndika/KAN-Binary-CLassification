I use KAN KAN KAN KAN KAN KAN KAN KAN KAN KAN KAN KAN KAN

Honestly i dont know what to write here
Activation Function learns rather than weight i suppose, replacing every weight with spline (Spine much better)

Proved to be better performance than MLP (Multilayer perceptron)
Still  some doubt because it was tested on small dataset

Pros:
- Easier to iterpret
- Smaller storage needed

Cons:
- slow af evethough  usig the same amout of parameter to MLP

Check out the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19756
Very gud paper but i can't understand the math and I can't read many sentences (me dumb)
